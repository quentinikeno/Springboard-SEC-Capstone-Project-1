# Math Worksheet Generator

### What is this?

This app allows users to create their very own, randomly generated math worksheets.

### How does it work?

On the home page, users will be shown a form where they can specify parameters for their worksheet to be generated. Then the generated worksheet and answer key will be shown to them with options to save and download them. The user with an account will have a profile page to see all of their saved sheets, as well as options to edit or delete their account.

Any user will be able to generate a worksheet and answer key without signing up. To save and access their worksheets for later, the user will have to create an account.
